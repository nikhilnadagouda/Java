# Java
Java programs which I solved along the way.

Each file has the following features:
1. Question for which the Java program is written
2. Approach is explained to an extent
3. Time Complexity
4. Space Complexity
5. Solution (Complete or just the main logic)

Caution: 
1. Solution might or might not be independently executable on its own.
2. Check the file name and the main class name in the file. They may be different.
   File name is to give idea of the problem without opening the file. 
   Class name is according to semantics.
